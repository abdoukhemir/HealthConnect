# **HealthConnect**

## **Project Description**

HealthConnect is a mobile application developed natively for Android using Kotlin and Android Studio. It aims to serve as a social platform specifically designed for patients, facilitating improved access to medical information and fostering interactions among patients and with healthcare professionals.

The application addresses common challenges faced by patients, such as obtaining reliable symptom analysis, quickly locating specialized doctors, and finding appropriate platforms to share their experiences and receive advice in a secure and confidential environment.

## **Features**

* **Symptom Analysis via AI:** Users can input their symptoms to receive automated suggestions and insights powered by an artificial intelligence engine.  
* **Symptom Publication:** Patients have the ability to publish their symptoms and health-related information as posts, allowing for community feedback and advice (with options for anonymity).  
* **Doctor Geolocation:** An interactive map feature to quickly locate specialized doctors in the vicinity.  
* **Secure Interactions:** Designed to provide a safe and confidential space for health-related discussions and information sharing.  
* **User-Friendly Interface:** An intuitive and ergonomic interface suitable for both patients and potentially healthcare professionals.

## **Technologies Used**

* **Kotlin:** The primary programming language for Android development.  
* **Android Studio:** The official Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Android development.  
* **Artificial Intelligence (AI) Engine:** TensorFlow Lite for symptom analysis.  
* **Geolocation API:** Integration with a mapping service API (e.g., Google Maps API) for doctor location features.  

## **Prerequisites**

* Android Studio installed.  
* A physical Android device or emulator for testing.  
* JDK (Java Development Kit) installed.  
* Basic knowledge of Kotlin and Android development.  
* (If using specific APIs like Google Maps or a cloud AI service) Necessary API keys and configurations.

## **Installation**

1. **Clone the repository:**  
   git clone \<repository\_url\>

   Navigate to the project directory:  
   cd HealthConnect

2. Open in Android Studio:  
   Open the project in Android Studio.  
3. Configure Dependencies:  
   Android Studio should automatically download the necessary dependencies. If not, ensure your build.gradle files are correctly configured and sync the project.  
4. (If applicable) Add API Keys:  
   If your project uses external APIs (like Google Maps or a specific AI service), you will need to add your API keys according to the project's structure and documentation.  
5. Run the app:  
   Connect an Android device or start an emulator. Select the device in Android Studio and click the "Run" button (green play icon).

## **Usage**

1. Launch the HealthConnect app on your Android device.  
2. Sign up or log in to your account.  
3. Explore the different features:  
   * Use the symptom analysis tool to get insights.  
   * Create and view posts related to health conditions.  
   * Use the map feature to find nearby doctors.  
   * Interact with other users securely.

## **Project Structure (Brief)**

The project follows a standard Android application structure. Key directories and files include:

* app/: Contains the main application code and resources.  
  * java/: Kotlin source files, organized by package.  
  * res/: Application resources (layouts, drawables, values, etc.).  
  * AndroidManifest.xml: Application manifest file.  
* gradle/: Gradle wrapper files.  
* build.gradle (project and module level): Build configuration files.

## **Development Methodology**

According to the project's specifications, development follows an Agile methodology, structured into sprints:

* **Sprint 1:** Authentication and symptom publication features.  
* **Sprint 2:** AI-based symptom analysis.  
* **Sprint 3:** Doctor geolocation feature.
